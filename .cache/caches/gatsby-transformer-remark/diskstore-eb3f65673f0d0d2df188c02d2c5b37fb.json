My Name is Nuppu Lehto. I'm a Helsinki-based, human-oriented production manager and assistant, currently finishing my Cultural Management thesis about touring and mental health.  </p>\n<p>My background working with artists is diverse â€“ I've worked with artists as a producer to help them create their visuals, as a management assistant to help them promote their career and build connections, as an artist host to make them feel safe and taken care of, and as a tour manager to make touring a secure and unforgettable experience for the artist, the crew and the audience. Within everything I do, I'm passionate about driving a positive change.  </p>\n<p><em>Starting 01.10.2023 I'm available for freelance or full-time positions.</em>  </p>\n<h2><strong>EXPERIENCE</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Management Assistant, pehmoaino</strong><br>\nFreelancer | Since 08/2023</p>\n<p><strong>Tour Management and Production, pehmoaino</strong><br>\nFreelancer | Since 05/2023<br>\nwww.fullsteam.fi/pehmoaino</p>\n<p><strong>2nd Tour Manager, ibe</strong><br>\nFreelancer | 2022<br>\nwww.suomenkeikkamyynti.fi/ibe</p>\n<p><strong>Video and Event Producer, Label Management Assistant</strong><br>\nSkorpioni | 01/2021 - 09/2022<br>\nwww.skorpioni.club</p>\n<p><strong>Freelance Event and Video Producer</strong><br>\nSince 01/2020</p>"}
