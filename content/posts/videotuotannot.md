Along my studies, I've worked as a producer in various video productions. By making music videos with Bajo Helsinki, I started learning about productions and the music industry. Later on I also got to join the production teams of Skorpioni and Words With W. 

In video productions I've worked as a producer overseeing and coordinating the productions process. My work in these projects has included planning the budget and schedules, helping with creative direction, casting talents and scouting locations, organizing logistics, managing deadlines and communicating with the team each step on the way. In each production my goal is to create an environment where everyone can feel safe, heard and seen.
