Hi! My Name is Nuppu Lehto. I'm a Helsinki-based, human-oriented production manager and assistant, currently finishing my Cultural Management thesis about touring and mental health.  

My background working with artists is diverse â€“ I've worked with artists as a producer to help them create their visuals, as a management assistant to help them promote their career and build connections, as an artist host to make them feel safe and taken care of, and as a tour manager to make touring a secure and unforgettable experience for the artist, the crew and the audience. Within everything I do, I'm passionate about driving a positive change.  

*Starting 01.10.2023 I'm available for freelance or full-time positions.*
